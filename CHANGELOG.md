# tljh-repo2docker Changelog

## 1.0.0 - Highlights

The purpose of this release is to allow for better compatibility of the plugin with different versions of The Littlest JupyterHub.

This plugin was initially developed for a previous version of TLJH when it was not versioned yet. Now TLJH is making proper releases and might start introducing new changes that might potentially be breaking.

In short:

- Use `v1.0.0` if you are using a version of TLJH that includes JupyterHub 1.
- A future major version (`v2`) of the `tljh-repo2docker` plugin will target TLJH 1.0 and JupyterHub 4 as minimal requirements.

:information_source: Note the current `v1.0.0` version should already be compatible with JupyterHub 4.

You can find below the list of changes since the creation of the plugin.
